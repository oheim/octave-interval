================

 * Increased speed of computation for large matrices
 
 * Improved performance for fma and dot
 
 * mpfr_vector_dot_d: Changed syntax for faster computation on intervals

 * Decorated versions of mtimes, mldivide, mpower, inv and reduction
   operations: sum, dot, subabs, subsquare
 
 * Renamed function sumsquare to sumsq in accordance with GNU Octave function
   names
 
 * New function: fzero for finding all zeros of an interval arithmetic function

Bugfixes
 * nextout: Function returned wrong results
 * exacttointerval: Now produces bare intervals instead of decorated intervals
                    in conformance with IEEE 1788
 * atanh: Function returned wrong results for +-1
 * dot: Function returned wrong results for some inputs
 * fma: Function returned wrong results for some inputs
 * infsup: Function returned wrong interval boundaries for decimal numbers,
           function failed on mixed numerical and string boundaries in single
           cell array parameter
 * mulrevtopair: Fixed order of operands in conformance with IEEE 1788 and
                 wrong results when evaluated on intervals that contain zero

Initial release version, which already contains all required operations of the
preliminary standard document IEEE P1788.
