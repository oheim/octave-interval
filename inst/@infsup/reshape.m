## Return an interval matrix with the specified dimensions (M, N) whose
## elements are taken from the interval matrix @var{A}.  The elements of the
## matrix are accessed in column-major order (like Fortran arrays are stored).
##
## Note that the total number of elements in the original matrix
## (@code{prod (size (@var{A}))}) must match the total number of elements in
## the new matrix (@code{prod ([@var{M} @var{N}])}).
##
## A single dimension of the return matrix may be left unspecified and
## Octave will determine its size automatically.  An empty matrix ([])
## is used to flag the unspecified dimension.
