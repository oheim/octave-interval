## @deftypefn {Interval Function} {} @var{X} ^ @var{Y}
## 
## Compute the general power function on intervals, which is defined for
## (1) any positive base @var{X}; (2) @code{@var{X} = 0} when @var{Y} is
## positive; (3) negative base @var{X} together with integral exponent @var{Y}.
##
## This definition complies with the common complex valued power function,
## restricted to the domain where results are real, plus limit values where
## @var{X} is zero.  The complex power function is defined by
## @code{exp (@var{Y} * log (@var{X}))} with initial branch of complex
## logarithm and complex exponential function.
##
## Warning: This function is not defined by IEEE 1788.
##
## Accuracy: The result is an accurate enclosure.  The result is tightest in
## each of the following cases:  @var{X} in @{0, 1, 2, 10@}, or @var{Y} in
## @{-1, 0.5, 0, 1, 2@}, or @var{X} and @var{Y} integral with
## @code{abs (pow (@var{X}, @var{Y})) in [2^-53, 2^53]}
##
## @example
## @group
## infsup (-5, 6) ^ infsup (2, 3)
##   @result{} [-125, +216]
## @end group
## @end example
## @seealso{pow, pown, pow2, pow10, exp}
