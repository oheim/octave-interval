## Query the current format's spacing configuration.
##
## This function supports a wide range of Octave versions.  The API to query
## the current format settings has undergone several incompatible
## modifications in the 4.0, 4.2 and 4.4 releases.
##
## @example
## @group
## format compact
## __loosespacing__
##   @result{} ans = 0
## @end group
## @group
## format loose
## __loosespacing__
##   @result{} ans =  1
## @end group
## @end example
## @seealso{format}
## @end deffun
