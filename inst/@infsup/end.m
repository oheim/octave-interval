## The magic index @code{end} refers to the last valid entry in an indexing
## operation.
##
## For @var{n} = 1 the output of the indexing operation is a column vector and a
## single index is used to address all entries in column-first order.  For
## @var{n} > 1 the @var{k}'th dimension is addressed separately.

## @example
## @group
## A = infsup ([1 2 3; 4 5 6]);
## A(1, end)
##   @result{} ans =  [3]
## A(end, 1)
##   @result{} ans =  [4]
## A(end)
##   @result{} ans =  [6]
