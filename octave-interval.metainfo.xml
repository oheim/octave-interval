     CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT
     PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT
     CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES
     THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO
     WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION
     OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES
     RESULTING FROM THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR
     WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically
confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the
creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an
original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work
for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate
in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any
form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to
promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of
creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work,
voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute
the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect
of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may
be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights
("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights
include, but are not limited to, the following:

    the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
    communicate, and translate a Work; moral rights retained by the
    original author(s) and/or performer(s); publicity and privacy
    rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a
    Work; rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a
    Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below; rights
    protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
    a Work; database rights (such as those arising under Directive
    96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
    1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national
    implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version
    of such directive); and other similar, equivalent or corresponding
    rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
    any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in
contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully,
permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and
surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and
associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown
(including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
"Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of
the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal
or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the
public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law,
then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted
taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In
addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants
to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to
exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by
applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in
any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv)
for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall
be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity
or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License,
and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action
with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

    No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived,
    abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this
    document.  Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
    representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work,
    express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without
    limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
    other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors,
    whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent
    permissible under applicable law.  Affirmer disclaims
    responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply
    to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any
    person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further,
    Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
    Work.  Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons
    is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with
    respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

		<p>The interval package for real-valued interval arithmetic allows one to evaluate functions over subsets of their domain.  All results are verified, because interval computations automatically keep track of any errors.</p>
		<p>These concepts can be used to handle uncertainties, estimate arithmetic errors and produce reliable results.  Also it can be applied to computer-assisted proofs, constraint programming, and verified computing.</p>
		<p>The implementation is based on interval boundaries represented by binary64 numbers and is conforming to IEEE Std 1788-2015, IEEE standard for interval arithmetic.</p>

		<p>Mit diesen Konzepten lassen sich ungewisse Messwerte behandeln, arithmetische Fehler abschätzen und zuverlässige Ergebnisse erzeugen.  Es kann auch für rechnergestützte Beweise, Constraintprogrammierung oder verifiziertes Rechnen angewandt werden.</p>
		<p>Die Intervallschranken werden im Zahlenformat binary64 geführt und die Umsetzung ist standardkonform zu IEEE Std 1788-2015, dem IEEE-Standard für Intervallarithmetik.</p>
