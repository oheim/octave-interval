Title: Real-valued interval arithmetic
Description: The interval package for real-valued interval arithmetic provides
 data types and operations for verified computing.  It can be used to handle
 uncertainties, estimate arithmetic errors and produce reliable results.  Also
 it can help find guaranteed solutions to numerical problems.  Thanks to
 GNU MPFR many arithmetic operations are provided with best possible accuracy.
 The implementation of intervals in inf-sup format is based on interval
 boundaries represented by binary64 numbers and is standard conforming to
 IEEE 1788.
Problems: Comparison with isequal fails for interval matrices in
 Octave 4.0.0 (bug #44334).
Depends: Octave (>= 3.8.2)
