Title: Real-valued interval arithmetic
Description: The interval package for real-valued interval arithmetic provides
 data types and operations for verified computing.  It can be used to handle
 uncertainties, estimate arithmetic errors and produce reliable results.  Also
 it can be applied to computer-assisted proofs, constraint programming and help
 find guaranteed solutions to numerical problems.  The implementation of
 intervals is based on interval boundaries represented by binary64 numbers and
 is standard conforming to IEEE 1788.
Problems: Comparison with isequal fails for interval matrices in
 Octave 4.0.0 (bug #44334).
