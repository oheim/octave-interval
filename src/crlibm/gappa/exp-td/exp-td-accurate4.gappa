# Gappa proof for the relative error of a polynomial approximation of exp(r)
# abs(r) \leq 2^(-12), 
# integrating the final adding step, the errors made in the polynomial approximation 
# and the argument reduction error
#
# THIS IS THE DIFFICULT CASE WHERE WE MUST SHOW THE EXACTNESS OF THE LAST ADD
